This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in PHP related to type hinting.  The `calculateSum` function expects an array of integers; however, it does not strictly enforce this. The example includes a string ('4') in the input array, which PHP implicitly converts to an integer (4), but could lead to unexpected behavior in other scenarios (e.g., 'abc' will lead to a warning and a value of 0). The solution demonstrates how to use strict type checking to prevent this.
